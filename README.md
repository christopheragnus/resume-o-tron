How to run:

- run `yarn` in both root folder and `server` folder
- run `yarn start` in both root and `server` folder

1. I chose this package manager because Yarn was the default manager and is sightly quicker than NPM.
2. I chose this Apollo as the GraphQL client because it has a ton of documentation and code examples and its fast to setup the boilerplate with it. Also, the API is very intuitive to use.
3. I'm especially proud of how fast I could easily build this app and how similar GraphQL’s mutations are to RESTful verbs. Querying data was much more succinct than using REST API endpoints.
4. I think this challenge is a 4/5. Not super hard, and React makes it easy to build components.
5. If there was one thing I could improve about GraphQL it would be - it probably needs a better explanation of the differences between clients and GraphQL servers out there. I just chose the most popular combination of React / Apollo and Prisma.
